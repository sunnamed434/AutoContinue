Ever been watching a YouTube video and that annoying "Continue watching?" popup keeps interrupting you? AutoContinue fixes that by automatically clicking the continue button so you can watch without interruptions.

## What it does

- Automatically clicks "Continue watching?" on YouTube so you don't have to
- Works on both YouTube and YouTube Music
- You can adjust how long it waits before clicking (idle timeout)
- Shows you how many times it's helped you out
- Has a test mode so you can see it working
- Available in multiple languages
- Doesn't collect any of your data - everything stays on your computer

## Getting started

### Install it

**Easiest way - Chrome Web Store:**
1. Go to the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/autocontinue)
2. Click "Add to Chrome"
3. That's it! It'll start working on YouTube right away

**Manual install (if you want the latest version):**
1. Download from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/sunnamed434/AutoContinue/releases)
2. Unzip the file
3. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`
4. Turn on "Developer mode" (toggle in top right)
5. Click "Load unpacked" and pick the folder you unzipped

### How to use it

Once installed, it just works automatically. But you can also:
- Click the extension icon to see how many times it's helped you
- Right-click the icon and pick "Options" to change settings
- Use the test mode to see it in action

## For developers

**You'll need:**
